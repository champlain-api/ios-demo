# Champlain API iOS Demo

This serves as a demo to showcase what a student could make using our Champlain API. Further optimizations could be made to the code, however it is just meant to showcase some usages of the API.


Some of the code is adapted from [Apple's Implementing modern collection views example code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/implementing-modern-collection-views).
